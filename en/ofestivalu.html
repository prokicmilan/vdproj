                            The first FEST, under the slogan "A Brave New World" was opened on the 9th of January 1971 in Dom Sindikata, 
                            with the screening of Robert Altman's Mash. Envisioned as the annual review of the best films of the season, 
                            the Belgrade International Film Festival - FEST – evolved to become one of the most important festivals on the 
                            continent and a pillar event of Belgrade's cultural life and an indispensable element in the coming of age of 
                            many generations of film fans.

                            Today, nearly five decades after its first edition, FEST continues to fulfil its cultural and educational role 
                            with the same energy, broadening the horizons of all film fans.

                            An important feature of FEST all these years has been its openness to films from all parts of the world, as well 
                            as to all relevant authors and works that would never have the opportunity to be shown in cinemas. Authors like 
                            Theo Angelopoulos, Bob Rafelson, Volker Schlöndorff, David Cronenberg, Ken Russel, Wim Wenders, Kieslowski, Herzog 
                            had the opportunity to meet each other for the first time in Belgrade, on FEST.

                            The first FEST was quite spectacular, featuring "A Space Odyssey" by Stanley Kubrick; Dennis Hopper's "Easy Rider"; 
                            the already mentioned "Mash" by Robert Altman; the films by Eric Rohmer, Louis Bunuel, Živojin Pavlović... 
                            Although many nostalgically, but rightfully so, consider this first edition of the Festival to be unmatched, 
                            the truth is that in the years that followed, FEST presented its audiences with many opportunities to see the 
                            films that have later been counted among the best in film history. Many illustrious international actors and 
                            directors have been the festival’s guests over the last four decades: Marcello Mastroianni, Harvey Keitel, 
                            Liv Ullman, Bernardo Bertolucci, Sophia Loren, Robert de Niro, Antonioni, Johnny Depp, Milos Forman, Catherine Deneuve, 
                            Wim Wenders, Abaz Kiarostami, Hanna Schygulla, Monica Bellucci, the above mentioned Rafelson, Schlöndorff, and Russell... 
                            a long, honourable and impressive list of names.

                            Since its inception, the main film programme of FEST has always been enriched with diverse accompanying ones, 
                            the quality of which often exceeded their supporting role. One should also mention numerous publications, as well 
                            as exhibitions and symposiums held during the Festival.

                            To date, FEST boasts four million visitors and nearly 4000 relevant international films, which have had their 
                            Yugoslav/Serbian and often regional premiere on the Festival.

                            In 2015 FEST was transformed into an official competition festival with four distinct competition selections: 
                            “The main competition programme” - international selection; "Serbian Film" - national selection; "Frontiers" - 
                            subversive, controversial and arthouse films that move borders in a thematic and aesthetic sense; and movies from 
                            region that compete for "Neboj&scaron;a &Dstrok;ukeli&cacute;" Award.
