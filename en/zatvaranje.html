                            The last screening of the festival was the movie "Face" by Polish director Malgorzata Szumowska, and since
                            the festival award ceremonies were held during the last two festival nights, instead of the closing ceremony,
                            the art director Jugoslav Panteli&cacute; spoke to the audience before the screening of the movie "I, Tonya" in Sava centar.

                            He pointed out that 418 screenings were held in the last ten days, out of which 116 premieres, in 12 halls across the city,
                            as well that over 70 guests visited the festival. Panteli&cacute; then decided to salute all those that are responsible for 
                            what FEST is today.

                            "Usually we salute stars, guests, jury members night after night, but now I'm asking you to salute
                            the group of people withoth who there would be no FEST", Panteli&cacute; said, and then asked the 
                            FEST crew to join him on the stage. The audience saluted the crew that worked on the festival with
                            an applause.

                            being even better in the years to come. We're already scheduling a meeting for the next year, the next
                            47. FEST will be held from 22. february to 3. march 2019", Panteli&cacute; added. He then reminsced
                            the famous Vlada Divljan, who left us three years ago, adding that his song "Samo jednu ljubav imam"
                            could be dedication of this night for all of us that love film.
